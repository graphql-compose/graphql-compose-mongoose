## What's new?

### A new way for resolver creation (via factory)

Before 9.0.0, `graphql-compose-mongoose` generated types & resolvers together on a `composeWithMongoose` call. This approach has the following disadvantages:
- no static analysis for resolver names (are you sure that `findById` exists?)
- under the hood generated around 15 resolvers and many graphql types for them (do you really use all of these resolvers?)
- no static analysis for available args when you are creating relations
- quite awkward mechanics of creating new resolvers, cloning, or wrapping them (what if you need to change type before resolvers creation? What if I need several copies of one resolver with a different set of args?)
- no `go-to` support in IDE via ctrl+click for opening resolver definition.

To overcome all these problems a new `composeMongoose` method was created. And I strongly recommend to migrate your codebase from the old `composeWithMongoose` to the new `composeMongoose`; making your code more stable and faster:

```diff
- import { composeWithMongoose } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';
+ import { composeMongoose } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';

// generate GraphQL types & resolvers from mongoose model
- const UserTC = composeWithMongoose(UserModel);
+ const UserTC = composeMongoose(UserModel);

// getting generated resolver by name `findById`
- const findByIdResolver = UserTC.getResolver('findById');
+ const findByIdResolver = UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findById();
```

Under the hood, when the new `composeMongoose` method is called, it:
- will create just two types: `ObjectTypeComposer` & `InputTypeComposer`
- will not generate resolvers automatically, but instead of this, it adds `mongooseResolvers` property with a factory for resolver creation on demand.

This will provide the following advantages:
- You may programmatically modify `TypeComposer` and only after that generate resolvers with their sub-types based on already customized fields in `TypeComposer`.
- Safe memory and time on the bootstrap server phase, because it won't generate unused resolvers.
- You may call one resolver generator several times with different configurations.
- `mongooseResolvers` factory has improved typescript definitions. And you will get not only a list of available resolvers by names but also their customization options. Moreover, all generated Resolvers will know its `source: Model<IDoc>`.
- According to the customization options for each resolver, you may control how your resolvers will be generated. Also, it unlocks the ability in future releases to add more options like `before` & `after` hooks, ACL, additional filters, and sorts params.

[Issue #263](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/263)

### An full example using TypeScript with mongoose, graphql-compose-mongoose, and a new DataLoader resolver.

An example of TypeScript usage with a lot of type checks and autosuggestions:

```ts
import { SchemaComposer } from 'graphql-compose';
import { composeMongoose } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';
import { mongoose } from 'mongoose';

// type for context which is provided by graphql-server
interface TContext {
  req: Request;
}

// creating a schema with TContext
const schemaComposer = new SchemaComposer<TContext>();

// describe mongoose schema for User
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
});

// define interface for your mongoose model IUser
interface IUser extends mongoose.Document {
  name: string;
}

// describe mongoose schema for Post
const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  authorId: { type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId },
  reviewerIds: { type: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId] },
});

// define interface for your mongoose model IPost
interface IPost extends mongoose.Document {
  title: string;
  authorId?: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  reviewerIds?: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId];
}

// Create mongoose models with typescript definitions
// Bored with describing fields two times for Schema and for Interface –
//   try typegoose: https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/
const UserModel = mongoose.model<IUser>('User', UserSchema);
const PostModel = mongoose.model<IPost>('Post', PostSchema);

// create ObjectTypeComposers via the new method
const UserTC = composeMongoose(UserModel);
const PostTC = composeMongoose(PostModel);

// make relations between Post <--> Author
// via adding a new field `author` and using DataLoader
PostTC.addRelation('author', {
  resolver: UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoader({ lean: true }),
  //                                ^^^         ^^^
  //                     autosuggestion for available resolvers and available options  
  prepareArgs: {
    // here will be allowed only the `_id` key, because only this arg is available on the `dataLoader` resolver
    _id: (source) => source.authorId,
    //                   ^^^ source is typed to IPost interface
  },
  projection: { authorId: true },
});

// Describe another relation via `dataLoaderMany`
PostTC.addRelation('reviewers', {
  resolver: UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoaderMany({ lean: true }),
  prepareArgs: {
    _ids: (s) => s.reviewerIds,
  },
  projection: { reviewerIds: true },
});

// defining schema entrypoints for Query
schemaComposer.Query.addFields({
  post: PostTC.mongooseResolvers.findById(),
  posts: PostTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany(),
  user: UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findById(),
  users: UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({ sort: false }),
});

// defining schema entrypoints for Mutation
schemaComposer.Query.addFields({
  postCreate: PostTC.mongooseResolvers.createOne(),
  userCreate: UserTC.mongooseResolvers.createOne(),
});

// generating GraphQL schema instance
const schema = schemaComposer.buildSchema();
```

### Expose `resolverFactory` for advanced cases of resolver creation

`graphql-compose-mongoose` exposes the `resolverFactory` variable which contains all available resolver generators, eg. `resolverFactory.createOne(someMongooseModel, someTC, customizationOpts)`. This way of resolver generation unlocks the following scenarios:
- you have several mongoose models with different databases connection and one TypeComposer, so you can reuse one GraphQL type for using it with different MongoDBs.
- you have one mongoose model and want to use different GraphQL types (for admins with a full set of fields, and for clients with a reduced set of fields).

The following example demonstrates how to use the second scenario with `ClonedPostTC` type for the reduced set of fields and existing mongoose `PostModel` for making requests to DB:

```ts
import { resolverFactory } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';
import { PostModel, PostTC } from './the-example-above';

const ClonedPostTC = PostTC.clone('ReducedPost');
ClonedPostTC.getInputTypeComposer().removeField('authorId');

const createPostWithoutAuthor = resolverFactory.createOne(PostModel, ClonedPostTC, { suffix: 'CustomCreate' });
```

[Issue #274](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/274)

### Mutations get a new `error: ErrorInterface` field in theirs payload for better error handling

All mutation resolvers get an `error` field in their payloads. And now clients may choose between two variants of how they may receive a runtime resolver error, if it happens.

1) First variant, as usual, via `errors` field in the response payload. Assume the following mutation produce runtime error:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
  }
}
```

Therefore, you would receive such a response from the GraphQL server:

```js
{
  data: { userCreate: null },
  errors: [{
    message: 'E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.users index: email_1',
    extensions: { ... },
    path: ['userCreate'],
  }],
}
```

2) And the second new variant of obtaining errors is – the `error` field in mutation payload:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
    error {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

In such case, you will get the error in the `userCreate.error` field and the top-level `errors` field will be undefined:

```js
{
  data: {
    userCreate: {
      error: {
        message: 'E11000 duplicate key error collection: test.users index: email_1',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Moreover, `userCreate.error` field is typed and may provide additional information for you. Let's take a look at the implementation of `error` field via SDL, which has some essential comments with technical explanations:

```graphql
type UserCreatePayload {
  recordId: Int
  # First of all the `error` field is described by Interface
  error: ErrorInterface
}

# Describing `UserCreatePayload.error` field by interface
# provides the following advantages:
# - you may return different types of errors with additional fields
# - no matter what type the error is, you may request the `message` field
interface ErrorInterface {
  message: String
}

# Currently in graphql-compose-mongoose there exist 3 error types -
# MongoError, ValidationError & RuntimeError

# MongoError is used if the error was thrown from the Database
# and contains an additional `code` field
# https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/base/error_codes.yml
type MongoError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  code: Int
}

# ValidationError is used if error was thrown by Mongoose
# when you create or update some documents.
type ValidationError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  errors: ValidatorError
}

# RuntimeError is used as a fallback type if no one of the previous error was met.
type RuntimeError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
}
```

So if clients need more details about mutation errors they able to write the following query:

```graphql
mutation {
  userCreate(...) {
    recordId
    error {
      message
      __typename
      ... on MongoError {
        code
      }
      ... on ValidationError {
        errors {
          message
          path
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Quite a long discussion about `error` implementation can be found in [issue #248](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/248)

### Added a new `ValidationError`

Resolvers `createOne`, `createMany`, `updateOne`, `updateById` now returns validator errors in the following shape:

```graphql
type ValidationError implements ErrorInterface {
  message: String
  errors: ValidatorError
}

type ValidatorError {
  message: String
  path: String
  value: JSON
  idx: Int!
}
```

So for such a query:

```graphql
mutation {
  createMany(
    records: [
      { name: "Ok" },
      { name: "John", someStrangeField: "Test" }
    ]
  ) {
    records {
      name
    }
    error {
      __typename
      message
      ... on ValidationError {
        errors {
          message
          path
          value
          idx
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You will receive the following response:

```js
{
  data: {
    createMany: {
      records: null,
      error: {
        __typename: 'ValidationError',
        message: 'Nothing has been saved. Some documents contain validation errors',
        errors: [
          {
            message: 'this is a validate message',
            path: 'someStrangeField',
            value: 'Test',
            idx: 1, // <-- points that the second document, which has the error
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

[Issue #248](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/248)

## Enhancements

### Now `_id` field can be of any type (Int, String, Object)

Before v9.0.0, only the `MongoID` type was supported for the `_id` field. Now, it can be of any type: `Int`, `String`, `Object`. To use this feature, you need to add the `_id` field to your mongoose schema with the desired type, and graphql-compose-mongoose will do the rest:

```ts
const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: { type: Number },
  title: { type: String },
});

interface IBook extends Document {
  _id: number;
  title?: string;
}

const BookModel = mongoose.model<IBook>('Book', BookSchema);
const BookTC = composeMongoose(BookModel);
```

Notes:

- If you choose type `Number` for `_id` field then `graphql-compose-mongoose` will cast it to `Int` GraphQL type. For other fields, `Number` is casted to `Float` by default. However, you have the ability to change the type manually – `BookTC.extendField('_id', { type: 'Float!' })`.
- Be careful: Mongoose will refuse to save a document that doesn't have an `_id`. So you're responsible for setting `_id` if you define your own `_id` path. For automatic numeric id creation you can use the following plugins [mongoose-plugin-autoinc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-plugin-autoinc) or [@typegoose/auto-increment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typegoose/auto-increment).

[Issue #141](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/141)

### Add nested fields support, new operators `regex`, `exists` for `filter._operators`

Resolvers which have `filter` arg have an `_operators` field, which allows you to write complex filtering logic with `AND`, `OR`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `ne`, `in`, `nin` operators. Now in v9.0.0, the following were added: `exists` & `regex`.
Also we have added support for nested fields like in `contacts.email` and `contacts.skype`:

```graphql
query {
  findUsers(
    filter: {
      _operators: {
        age: { gt: 10, lt: 20 },
        address: { country: { in: ["US"] } },
        contacts: {
          email: { regex: "/3.COM/i" },
          skype: { exists: true },
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    _id
    name
    age
  }
}
```

By default, for performance reason, `graphql-compose-mongoose` generates operators *only for indexed* fields. BUT you may enable operators for all fields when creating resolver in the following way:

```ts
const userFindMany = UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({
  filter: {
    // enables all operators for all fields
    operators: true,
  }
});
```

OR provide a more granular `operators` configuration to suit your needs:

```ts
const userFindMany2 = UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({
  filter: {
    // more granular operators configuration
    operators: {
      // for `age` field add just 3 operators
      age: ['in', 'gt', 'lt'],
      // for non-indexed `amount` field add all operators
      amount: true,
      // don't add this field to operators
      indexedField: false,
    },
  },
  // add suffix for avoiding type names collision with resolver above
  suffix: 'AnotherFindMany',
)};
```

[Issue #250](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/250)

### Better alias support for nested embedded fields

Mongoose supports [aliases](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#aliases) for fields. You may have short field names in DB `t`, `a` but they will be present in your models and graphql types under the full names – `title`, `author`:

```ts
const BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: { type: Number },
  t: { type: String, alias: 'title' },
  a: { type: AuthorSchema, alias: 'author' },
  meta: {
    v: { type: Number, alias: 'votes' },
    f: { type: Number, alias: 'favs' },
  }
});
```

From the example above, you will notice that aliases can be used for embedded fields like `votes` & `favs`.

Moreover, `graphql-compose-mongoose` re-implements alias logic to make alias support in resolvers with the `lean: true` option (when graphql gets raw documents from the database).

[Issue #273](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/273)

## Performance improvements

### Added projection for nested embedded documents

Before v9.0.0, we only supported top-level fields projections. But now `graphql-compose-mongoose` supports projection for embedded (nested) fields. It helps reduce data transfer between MongoDB and GraphQL server.

[Issue #273](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/273)

### Added new `dataLoader` & `dataLoaderMany` resolvers

These resolvers are helpful for relations construction between Entities for avoiding the N+1 Problem via [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader). This problem occurs when a client requests an array of records with some relation data:
- a GraphQL call will first resolve the query for the array of records,
- then, for every record, will call nested resolve methods which make separate DB requests

As you can expect, doing N+1 queries will flood your database with queries, which is something we can and *should* avoid. So `dataLoader`, `dataLoaderMany` resolvers make one batch request for getting all related records by `_id`.

```ts
import { schemaComposer } from 'graphql-compose';
import { composeMongoose } from 'graphql-compose-mongoose';
import { mongoose, Document } from 'mongoose';

mongoose.set('debug', true); // <-- show mongoose queries in console

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
});
const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  authorId: { type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId },
  reviewerIds: { type: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId] },
});

interface IUser extends Document {
  name: string;
}

interface IPost extends Document {
  title: string;
  authorId?: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  reviewerIds?: [mongoose.Types.ObjectId];
}

const UserModel = mongoose.model<IUser>('User', UserSchema);
const PostModel = mongoose.model<IPost>('Post', PostSchema);

const UserTC = composeMongoose(UserModel);
const PostTC = composeMongoose(PostModel);

PostTC.addRelation('author', {
  // resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findById({ lean: true }),
  resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoader({ lean: true }),
  prepareArgs: {
    _id: (s) => s.authorId,
  },
  projection: { authorId: true },
});

PostTC.addRelation('reviewers', {
  // resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.findByIds({ lean: true }),
  resolver: () => UserTC.mongooseResolvers.dataLoaderMany({ lean: true }),
  prepareArgs: {
    _ids: (s) => s.reviewerIds,
  },
  projection: { reviewerIds: true },
});

schemaComposer.Query.addFields({
  posts: PostTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany(),
});

// console.log(schemaComposer.toSDL());
export const schema = schemaComposer.buildSchema();
```

Test suite for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/blob/master/src/__tests__/github_issues/260-test.ts).

### Add `lean: boolean` option to query resolvers

Resolvers with `lean: true` are significantly faster than without it (anywhere from 3 - 10 times faster), [Mongoose Docs on Lean](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/tutorials/lean.html). If you need just `raw` data from DB then use this option. By default queries return fully instantiated Mongoose documents for supporting mongoose's `virtuals` fields, plugins and model methods (but it consumes much more CPU & RAM).

The `lean` option is available in the following resolvers `findById`, `findByIds`, `findMany`, `findOne`, `dataLoader`, `dataLoaderMany`.

BTW mongoose `aliases` are supported with `lean: true` option. `graphql-compose-mongoose` takes care of their proper conversion in filters, projection and output results:

```ts
// With aliases in MongoDB you will have such records
//   { _id: '...', n: 'John', a: 26 }
const AuthorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, alias: 'n' },
  score: { type: Number, alias: 's' },
});
const AuthorModel = mongoose.model<IAuthor>('Author', AuthorSchema);

// A graphql type with full field names will be generated
//   type Author { name: String, score: Float }
const AuthorTC = composeMongoose(AuthorModel, { schemaComposer });

// Resolver will send queries something like this:
//   db.author.find({ n: 'John' })
// And convert shortened raw records to full form
//   { _id: '...', n: 'John', s: 26 }
const userFindManyResolver = AuthorTC.mongooseResolvers.findMany({ lean: true });
```

- feat add `lean: true` option #259, #266 [commit](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/commit/321dded4e2b346e5ab3d549a6bc5b31458478fd1)

## Breaking changes

### Changed Resolver `updateById` input args

`_id` field was removed from the `UpdateByIdRecord` input type, and added to the top level

```diff
- updateById(record: UpdateByIdRecord!)
+ updateById(_id: MongoID!, record: UpdateByIdRecord!)
```

[Issue #257](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/257)

### `createMany` resolver now validates all records before save

Before 9.0.0, `graphql-compose-mongoose` would save some records provided to `createMany` even if another had failed with a validation error. At first it will check that all records are valid before saving; and if some records contain errors, then no one document will be saved.

### Some generated types were renamed

- type for `filter._operators` field. Was `OperatorsXXXFilterInput`, which now becomes `XXXFilterOperatorsInput`. This helps keep all generated types with the same prefix for `XXX` entity.
- in the `count` resolver, we changed the `filter` type name from `Filter` to `FilterCount`. All other resolvers already had `FilterFindMany`, `FilterFindOne`, etc. names; only the `count` resolver did not follow this pattern.

### `findMany` and `findByIds` output type NonNull
- Output type for the `findMany` resolver is now NonNull of List of NonNull of (WrappedType)
- Used to be List of NonNull of (WrappedType)

## Misc

- Refactor `pagination` & `connection` resolvers (now they are dependencies) [#272](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/272)
- Allow the ability to provide `suffixes` for resolvers configs [#268](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/268)
- Remove `getRecordIdFn()` [#262](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-mongoose/issues/262)
- TypeScript definition improvements for resolvers: `source` is now typed, and first level of available `args` in resolvers

## Thanks
